## Introduction
"Retro Future provides a marketplace for the worldâ€™s most coveted items in the smartest way possible. Buy and sell the vintage apparel, electronics, music, and accessories."

## How It Works
**BUSINESS SIDE**<br>
Selling:<br>
1. Place an selling price and/or optional bidding starting point
2. Once the item is sold, the seller ships the item to Retro Future
3. Retro Future authenticates the product and quality, then pays out the seller

Buy: <br>
1. Place a bid or buy an item at selling price
2. Retro Future authenticates product
3. Retro Future ships product to you

Retro Future acts as a marketplace, product authenticator, and quality assurer.

Seller cancellation penalty:
To order to ensure the integrity of the marketplace, a fee of 15% of the transaction price will be assessed to your account if:
1. You fail to ship your item within 2 business days
2. Item does not pass the verification
